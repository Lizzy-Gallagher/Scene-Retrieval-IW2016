SESSION ID METHOD
-------------------------------------------
Each connection is given an id.
Then you make multiple calls using that id, each time the set is filtered. i.e. all the requests must be true of that set.

1. Create route that is getQueryId, returns some number
2. Keep the results for each query stored until asked to return
3. Use itertools to calculate the intersection of the sets.

Javascript Method
-------------------------------------------
1. Make multiple calls (as returned by nlp), with each additional call perform an intersect or difference (see http://2ality.com/2015/01/es6-set-operations.html )
